The Sales taxes problem. 

The problem is solved using python due to its simplicity. 
Since I got no requirement specification so I let my fantasy build the store. 
Moreover since the input contains food, medecins, books I assumed that the store is very big and contains diffrent items of diffrent categories and therefore the user only have to provide the the description of the product. 

It is a console application that takes the input of the user one at the time. The application expects the user to provide the name, price , amount and if the product is imported. 

The project is built with test driven programming there I added a folder with unittests for diffrent parts of the code.'
To print out the output of diffrent input that are given in chlallenge description run the app and  just follow the instructions in the terminal and choose "To display the former baskets please type 1"

Please contact me in case of any questions. I did not have any extra modules so the project should run without any additional packages if you have the requirement to run python on your  machine. 

OBS: There is a class diagram however it is in PDF format.
