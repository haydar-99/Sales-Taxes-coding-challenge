The Sales taxes problem. 
The problem is solved using python due to its simplicity and ability to solve math problems. 
Since i got no requirement specification so I let my fantasy build the store. 
Moreover since the input contains food, medecins, books I assumed that the store is very big and contains diffrent items of diffrent categories and therefore the user only have to provide the the description of the product. 

It is a console application that takes the input of the user one at the time. The application expect the user to provide the name, price , amount and if the product is imported. 

The project is built with test driven programming there I added a folder with unittests for diffrent parts of the code.'
To print out the output of diffrent input that are given in chlallenge description just follow the instructions in the terminal and choose "To display the former baskets please type 1"
